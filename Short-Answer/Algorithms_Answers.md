#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b)O(n1/2 n^2) which is just O(n^2)


c) O(n)

## Exercise II

O(log n)

I would use a bineary search algorithm, and am assuming that the floors are sorted in a way that the bottom floor is the lowest number and the top floor is the highest. I would test
egg at the middle floor. if it breakes go to the middle of the bottom half and if it doesn't break go to the middle of the top half. and repeat that process untill the highest floor without breaking the egg is found.
